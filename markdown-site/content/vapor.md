# 🔙 Vapor (Swift Backend Framework)

**Vapor** is our backend framework written in **Swift**. It allows us to build fast, reliable APIs and backend services.

### ⚙️ What It Powers
- User authentication and token handling
- API routes and controllers
- Business logic and validation
- Interactions with the database (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

### 🧠 For New Developers
You’ll mostly work in the `Sources/App/` directory. Familiarize yourself with:
- `routes.swift`: Defines API routes
- `Controllers/`: Handles incoming requests
- `Models/`: Defines data structures

To run the backend locally:

```bash
vapor xcode -y
