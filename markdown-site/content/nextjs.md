# ⚛️ Next.js (Frontend Framework)

**Next.js** is the framework we use to build the frontend of our web applications. It’s built on top of React and adds powerful features like:

### 🔧 Key Features
- **Server-side rendering (SSR)** and **Static Site Generation (SSG)**
- **App Router** for intuitive file-based navigation
- **Built-in API routes** for simple backend logic
- **TypeScript** support out of the box
- Seamless integration with **Tailwind CSS** and **ShadCN UI**

### 📘 Why We Use It
- Helps us build fast, SEO-friendly apps
- Scales well across teams
- Good developer experience with live reload, error overlays, and modern tooling

### 🧠 For New Developers
You’ll primarily work in the `app/` folder. Each route corresponds to a file, and components are typically shared via `components/`.

Start exploring the UI by running:

```bash
npm run dev
