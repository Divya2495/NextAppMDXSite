# 🎨 Figma (Design Collaboration Tool)

We use **Figma** for all design work — from mockups to interactive prototypes.

### 🔍 How We Use It
- Create and review UI/UX designs
- Collaborate on component behavior
- Inspect CSS, spacing, colors directly from Figma

### 🧠 For New Developers
Your designer will usually share a Figma link. Use **Figma's Inspect tab** to get spacing, colors, and text sizes. You don’t need a paid account to view designs.
