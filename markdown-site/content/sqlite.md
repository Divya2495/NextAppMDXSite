# 🗃️ SQLite (Local Database)

**SQLite** is a lightweight, file-based relational database that we use for **local development and prototyping**.

### ✅ Why SQLite?
- Simple to set up — no separate server needed
- Fast and embedded in the application
- Ideal for testing, quick development, or apps with small-scale data needs

### 🧠 For New Developers
When running the backend locally, your data is stored in a `.sqlite` file. You can inspect or reset it without needing a running database service.
